## About 

I am a CS Instructor, I teach k-12 students about the fundamentals of programming and build projects HS students use to display in their portfolio. I am working on a ML rocket recovery simulator and VR Speech and Debate simulator for two of my students who will be applying to competitive schools like the top UC's and Ivy League universities. I've had to learn new tools(MLAgents(GAIL, Behavioral Cloning, Experiment Design), ChatGPT API, http-server, Reinforced Learning) to bring my students projects to life and to teach my students how they can use them.

Outside of work, I have a multi-disciplinary study. I started off in Game Development for Unity in HS, then went on to algorithms/embedded systems/AI/ML/Computer Networking in College. And finally, I'm working on web projects(Display Current Track(Spotify Widget) and Personal Website). I've never stuck to one area because I **like** solving problems. Since I've been exposed to so many fields, it was natural for me to explore a variety of problems. I'm experienced with learning new skills and studying.

I'm self-motivated and hard working. I'm proud of my work and am continuously improving to reflect that.
