I am a CS Instructor, I teach k-12 students about the fundamentals of programming and build projects HS students use to display in their portfolio. I currently work on ML rocket recovery simulator and VR Speech and Debate simulator projects for my students who apply to competitive universities. I learn new tools***(MLAgents(GAIL, Behavioral Cloning, Experiment Design), ChatGPT API, http-server, Reinforced Learning)*** with each student to bring their projects to life and to provide my students an understanding of the tools, project, and goal.

Outside of work, I have a multi-disciplinary study. I created work in Game Development in HS, algorithms/embedded systems/AI/ML/Computer Networking in College. I am now working on Web Development projects***(Display Current Track(Spotify Widget) and Personal Website)***. I invest in numerous programming fields because problem solving methods have overlap. Learning about these has helped me bridge my understanding and help me in my current job, where I have to pick up new tools for every student project. 

Because of my work environment and hobbies, I'm adaptable and quickly learn. Due to my work in many different fields, I'm confident I can solve a problem; its only a matter of time.
