I am a **Computer Science Instructor** that teaches k-12 students about the fundamentals of programming. I am also a **Project Lead** that helps High School students build their portfolio. I currently work on a ***Machine Learning rocket recovery simulator*** and ***VR Speech and Debate simulator***. I have a variety of tools I am currently using*(MLAgents(GAIL, Behavioral Cloning, Experiment Design), ChatGPT API, http-server, Reinforced Learning)* as well as teaching with my students.

Outside of work, I build projects in different programming fields. I worked on projects in ***Game Development*** in HS and in University I worked on ***algorithms/embedded systems/AI/ML/Computer Networking***. I am now working on Web Development projects***(Display Current Track(Spotify Widget) and Personal Website)***. Problem solving has become one of my strong suites due to my work experience and projects. My projects in different programming fields has given me a broad set of problem solving methods, which has helped me in my current job to bring the ideas my students have to life.

Because of my work environment and hobbies, I'm adaptable and quickly learn; confident I can solve any problem.
